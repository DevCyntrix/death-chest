# Installation

If you decide to use my Death Chest plugin, you can download the latest version from one of these websites:&#x20;

Spigot: [https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/death-chest.101066/](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/death-chest.101066/) \
Hangar: [https://hangar.papermc.io/CyntrixAlgorithm/DeathChest](https://hangar.papermc.io/CyntrixAlgorithm/DeathChest) \
GitHub: [https://github.com/DevCyntrix/death-chest/releases ](https://github.com/DevCyntrix/death-chest/releases)

Once you have downloaded the latest jar file, you can move the file to the plugins folder on your Spigot server. Now you need to restart the server and have fun!&#x20;

**Notice**: You need items in your inventory to spawn a chest
