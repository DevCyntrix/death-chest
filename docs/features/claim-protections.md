# Claim Protections

The following protection plugins are supported by the deathchest plugin:

* **GriefPrevetion**
* **PlotSquared**
* **RedProtection**
* **WorldGuard**: Has also a flag to allow death chests on specific claims.

Supported means that no chest will spawn if the player does not have access to the claim. This prevents other claims from being modified and allows the player to always have access to the chest. Of course, if the player dies on a claim, the items will be dropped.
